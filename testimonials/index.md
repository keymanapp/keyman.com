## What people are saying about Keyman {.red .underline}

<p class="center">
  <span class="testimonial">I’m especially grateful for the hint feature, Start of Sentence detection, and the predictive text feature. These things make life very easy, and Keyman itself is a lifesaver for minority languages. Thanks for giving power to speakers of these languages.</span>
