  <span class="testimonial">"I only wish I had discovered Keyman sooner. For typing Polytonic Greek, I know of no better solution for the Windows Operating System than Keyman (and I've tried a handful of solutions). Where Windows has fallen remarkably short, Keyman has picked up the slack. I recommend the software to anyone and everyone who needs to integrate Greek scripting into their written prose."</span>

I have no knowledge of computer systems intricacies. I believe in the same way: it is wonderful. I wish Marc and his associates a grand success for developing software like this."</span>
