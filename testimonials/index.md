One of a kind
<br><br>
It took a lot of apps to find a full keyboard in desired language with all the letters on one page without the need of an Alt button. It’s easier to download and install than other apps that require you to program your own especially for someone who doesn’t have an idea how.

<p class="center">
  <span class="testimonial">I must admit you are doing a great service to linguistic community in developing this type of software which is essential for developing Keyboards and language-specific software by this. I had written to someone who has a master's degree in computer application (MCA), was full of praise of this software. He was not aware of it, and added that it is a wonderful tool. I have no knowledge of computer systems intricacies. I believe in the same way: it is wonderful. I wish Marc and his associates a grand success for developing software like this.</span>
