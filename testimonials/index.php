Everyone I've shown this to has taken it up quickly, without a lot of instruction, and have liked it a lot. The keyboard mapping and documentation are particularly good."</span>

  <span class="testimonial">"I only wish I had discovered Keyman sooner. For typing Polytonic Greek, I know of no better solution for the Windows Operating System than Keyman (and I've tried a handful of solutions). Where Windows has fallen remarkably short, Keyman has picked up the slack. I recommend the software to anyone and everyone who needs to integrate Greek scripting into their written prose."</span>

  <span class="testimonial">"I must admit you are doing a great service to linguistic community in developing this type of software which is essential for developing Keyboards and language-specific software by this. I had written to someone who has a master's degree in computer application (MCA), was full of praise of this software. He was not aware of it, and added that it is a wonderful tool. I have no knowledge of computer systems intricacies. I believe in the same way: it is wonderful. I wish Marc and his associates a grand success for developing software like this."</span>
