<h2 class="null">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>If I bought a license of Keyman from Tavultesoft before the free version was available, can I get a refund?</dt>
  <dd>No. Tavultesoft is not offering refunds.</dd>

  <dt>Who do I go to for technical support?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Support has transitioned to be primarily community based. We have two new locations for Keyman technical support:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href='https://community.software.sil.org/c/keyman'>SIL Keyman Community</a> - for general Keyman technical support</li>
      <li><a href='https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=%5Bkeyman%5D'>Stack Overflow</a> - for support on creating keyboard layouts with Keyman Developer (<a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=keyman,keyman-developer,keyboard,unicode'>ask a question</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <p>The <a href="https://secure.tavultesoft.com/forums">Tavultesoft Forums</a> are now read only.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>I have an existing license for Keyman Desktop. What happens to that license?</dt>
  <dd>Your license will continue to work. SIL and Tavultesoft are committed to keeping the license servers running. However, we would encourage you to upgrade to version <?php echo $stable_version; ?>, which is completely free.</dd>

  <dt>What are SIL&rsquo;s long-term plans for Keyman?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>SIL will continue to provide Keyman as a user-friendly downloadable program with the existing and growing catalogue of high quality keyboard layouts.</p>

    <p>SIL&rsquo;s long-term goal is to provide a freely available and extensible keyboarding platform, using Keyman as a foundation. SIL is working with standards organisations to create a global keyboarding standard, and will update Keyman to be the open source reference implementation for all major operating systems.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>What is Marc Durdin doing?</dt>
  <dd>You may know Marc as the primary developer of Keyman. Marc is leading the SIL team developing the Keyman projects within SIL.</dd>

  <dt>What is happening to Tavultesoft?</dt>
  <dd>Tavultesoft will continue to operate as a consulting microbusiness, mostly for Keyman-related projects. As SIL now owns the Keyman IP, Tavultesoft has ceased all development and direct technical support on Keyman itself.</dd>

  <dt>How can I support the development of Keyman?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>You can support the Keyman project through financially partnering with Marc&rsquo;s family. SIL members are funded through partnership with individuals and organisations that support the vision of SIL. Please visit&nbsp;<a href="https://durdin.net/">https://durdin.net/</a> to learn more about the Durdin family&rsquo;s journey.</p>

    <p>You can also donate directly to the Keyman project through the Keyman website at&nbsp;<a href="<?= KeymanHosts::Instance()->keyman_com ?>/donate"><?= KeymanHosts::Instance()->keyman_com_host ?>/donate</a>.</p>
