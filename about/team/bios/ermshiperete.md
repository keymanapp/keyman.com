I am one of the few non-native English speakers in the team, coming from
Germany. I have a degree in computer science from the University of Applied
Sciences in Karlsruhe. After working in a small software company for several
years I joined SIL’s language software development department where I worked on
different projects with a focus on maintaining cross-platform compatibility of
our products. During my time with the Keyman team I mainly worked on all aspects
of Keyman for Linux.

If I happen to have some spare time I enjoy reading, bicycling and other outdoor
activities.
