### Developer - Linux (former)

<br/>

I'm from Northern Ireland and I have a Natural Sciences degree from Cambridge.
I've been working on the Linux side of Keyman since May 2018. Prior to that I've
been working as a software developer and/or volunteering on various free and
open software projects.

I enjoy audax, other non-speedy cycling, and board games.

Daniel helped release the first version of Keyman for Linux.
