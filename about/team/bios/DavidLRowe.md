### Keyboards maintainer

<br/>

I began working with SIL Global in 1985 and served in various computer support
roles in Benin, Togo, Mali and other West African countries, as well as in the
USA. I've been creating Keyman keyboards on and off for three decades. My wife
and I currently live in Alaska near one of our sons and his family.
