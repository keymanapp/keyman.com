### Developer - Web, Predictive Text

<br/>

I grew up in the United States watching lots of science-fiction shows. I always
loved the grand vision of the future those shows set out, with people of various
ethnicities, races, and even species all working together in harmony... well, at
least most of the time. This led me to a stint as a graduate student at the
University of Florida, during which time I became interested in work in natural
language processing and computational linguistics. While searching for data
necessary for my research, I became aware of the technological issues suffered
by many of the world's people groups - a problem that Keyman has been addressing
for years. When someone lacks the ability to type effectively in their own
language, how can we communicate or collaborate effectively with them?

Growing up during our new "Information Age" has given me a great appreciation
for what technology can do to bring people together and facilitate
cross-cultural relationships, but it can only do so when people can effectively
use it. Toward this end, I completed a Doctorate of Computer Engineering there
in August 2015, after which I worked for a year and a half as an adjunct
lecturer at the University of Florida. Now, as of May 2017 I've joined the
Keyman team as a software developer.
