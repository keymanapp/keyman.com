### Support and Test Engineer

<br/>

During my 3rd year of acquiring a computer science degree at National
Polytechnic Institute of Cambodia, I got the opportunity to be involved in the
Keyman's work, and until the 4th year, I got a role in Keyman as a Technical
Support Engineer. If you are interested in my study, I have the source code
(Laravel) of my Thesis on
[GitHub](https://github.com/Meng-Heng/bus_ticketing_web).

I managed to obtain some experience through an internship in Web Development for
a POS system company based in Toul Kork, Phnom Penh, Cambodia. I also worked on
simplistic app and website design and development before the classes' deadlines
and kept up with the various programming languages the school had.

After successfully defending my Thesis and graduating, I continue to have a
passion for supporting Keyman's users. The responsibility of a technical support
engineer is to provide and form sophisticated help instructions according to
users' requirements, monitor Keyman's social platforms and blogs, write
documents, report bugs to the product developers, and use programming skills to
fix bugs, add features, and make updates to the Keyman websites.
