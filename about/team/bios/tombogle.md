### Developer - macOS (former)

<br/>

I grew up in beautiful Minnesota (or Minne-SNOW-ta as some people call it). I graduated with a degree in computer
science from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in 1991. After working as a consultant and contract programmer for
several years in Chicago, my family and I moved to Waxhaw, NC. Since 1998, I have worked on various SIL language
software projects to help linguists and translators do their jobs. I am fluent in Spanish, which I learned from my
wife.

In addition to my software work, I also enjoy swimming and other water sports, baking and cooking, day hiking, and
working with youth. Since 2015, my wife and I have been welcoming foster children into our home.

Tom continues to work in SIL Language Technology.
