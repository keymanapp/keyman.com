### Team Lead - Eastern Hemisphere, Developer - Windows

<br/>

With degrees in Electronics and Information Technology from QUT, I have worked
across various roles in software and electronics engineering. This has given me
experience in high-availability systems, microcontroller design, and software
development. With Keyman, I contribute mostly to the Keyman for Windows product.
I am based in Australia and outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my
family, mountain biking and road cycling.
