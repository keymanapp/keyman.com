I grew up in a small indigenous village in Bolivia. Living amongst a
very small, and oppressed, people group, I grew up with an innate desire
to help disadvantaged peoples.

My work with SIL Global has spanned 40 years, serving in England, Kenya,
and in the USA. In addition to my work with Keyman, I serve as one of
SIL's liaisons to the Unicode Consortium, do script research, develop
fonts, I am the Script and Writing Systems Editor for the Ethnologue
(https://www.ethnologue.com/credits/), and manage the data in the
language tags registry (https://github.com/silnrsi/langtags) that SIL
maintains.

My husband and I live in Dallas, TX (USA). In my spare time I enjoy
gardening and reading.
