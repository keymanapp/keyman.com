My name is Sabine Schmitt, and I live in the far south of Germany together with
my husband. I am an engineer and worked at a research institute as a C++
software developer for many years. In this role, I was responsible for the
development and maintenance of a graphical user interface for scientific
simulation tools.

After our four children left home for university, I joined the Keyman team as a
Software developer in 2021. My first projects involved adapting existing Windows
C++ code so that it could be used cross-platform. Currently, I'm converting
various keyboard layout file formats to Keyman Developer's KMN format.

In my free time, I enjoy inline skating, which I find very relaxing. I like to
go on longer or multi-day tours and regularly attend night skating events.
