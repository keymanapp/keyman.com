I’ve long been interested in languages, accessibility, and input—and computers.
These didn't always intersect.  I built a chorded keyboard after hearing Steven
K. Roberts speak.  My keyboard had eight switches, one for each bit of ASCII.
In grade school I used to doodle circuits for the micromouse competition, or for
refreshable braille displays.  I spent a year working on the island of Malta,
for a more international perspective.  Later, I helped start [the Maltese Wikipedija](https://mt.wikipedia.org)
and was involved in language standardization. I first ran into Keyman through
the Windows keyboard driver that was licensed through the government of Malta.

After a long run with IBM’s Corporate Globalization team, I set out on my own in
2020, with my own consultancy [Code Hive Tx, LLC](https://codehivetx.us) based
in Dripping Springs, near Austin, Texas, USA.  Besides corporate globalization
projects, I continue to contribute to Unicode’s Common Locale Data Repository
(CLDR), and chair its
[Digitally Disadvantaged Languages](https://cldr.unicode.org/ddl) working group.

As for Keyboards, I have been involved in [LDML Keyboards](/ldml) as the CLDR
spec editor, and have been involved in the implementation of LDML in Keyman,
both on the compiler (kmc) and runtime (core) portions.
