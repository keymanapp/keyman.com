<br/>

I wrote the first versions of Keyman, as a teenager while living in Laos, in
between home schooling and riding my bicycle around town fixing NGO computers.
After moving to Tasmania for University, where I completed a Bachelor of
Computing degree, I worked with my wife for a year in Papua New Guinea as a
volunteer with Australian Volunteers International. I continued part-time
development of Keyman during and after University and started working full time
on the full suite of Keyman projects in 2005.

Outside work I still ride my bike. We have two adult daughters and one son;
currently, we are living in southern Germany where I am work as the Project
Manager for Keyman within SIL. I can speak, read, and write (and type!), to
varying degrees, Khmer, Lao, Thai, and Tok Pisin, used to speak French as a
child, and am now learning German.
