### Technical Support Engineer (former)

<br/>

On immigrating to Australia, Peirce served with Keyman for four years
(2008-2012), where he especially enjoyed doing keyboard documentation and
customer care. He and his wife, Christina, now run an off-grid Christian hostel
([Pilgrim Hill](https://pilgrimhill.com.au)) in the hills of Tasmania’s
beautiful Huon Valley, where they also raise their insanely large family.
