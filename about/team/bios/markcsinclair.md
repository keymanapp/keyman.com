I am a systems developer and experienced university teacher in computer science
and telecommunications, with research interests in computational intelligence
and network design. I was committed to the development of higher education in
Cambodia over eighteen years, including co-founding an MSc, two university
departments and a software house.  After three years at Northumbria University
as Assistant Professor in Computer & Information Sciences, I moved to CAP
(Christians Against Poverty) as a systems developer.  Following financial
difficulties at CAP, I took voluntary redundancy, and alongside phased
retirement, have subsequently had three fixed-term contracts as an MSc Project
Supervisor in Computing Science at the University of Glasgow; Academic Mentor in
Computer Science at NPIC (for SIL in Cambodia); and now as Senior Software
Developer for SIL in Cambodia.

I have a BA and MA in Electrical Sciences from Pembroke College, University of
Cambridge; an MSc in Telecommunication and Information Systems, and a PhD in
Electronic Systems Engineering from the University of Essex.  I am a Chartered
Engineer, a member of both the IET and IEEE, and a Fellow of the Higher
Education Academy.  I am a Visiting Professor of Computer Science at NPIC in
Cambodia.

I am married, with two adult children, and two cats.  I love playing computer
games, reading science fiction and fantasy novels, going to the cinema and
theatre, and am an active member of my local church.
