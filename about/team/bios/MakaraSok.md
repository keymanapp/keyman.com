### Support and Test Engineer (former)

<br/>

My name is Makara. I have just graduated with an MA in Linguistics. The topic of
my thesis was about how to convert Khmer words into IPA. It was a really fun
project to do because I got to incorporate my limited knowledge in coding into
the making of the tool with the help of my advisor, and contribute to Khmer
language research. I love to explore new technological things and that is why I
am now here to help and learn from the Keyman team.

Makara now leads the Cambodia Linguistics Organization.
