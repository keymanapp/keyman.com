### Support and Test Engineer (former)

<br/>

I worked at Keyman as a Technical Support Engineer, where I helped users
troubleshoot issues and passed feedback along to the developers. I also worked
on creating keyboards and lexical models for many different scripts, including
the first Khmer LDML keyboard. Along the way, I contributed to rebuilding the
Keyman Browser for iOS and Android and helped develop a Khmer script
normalization tool for Cambodia Linguistics Organization.

Nyny has now embarked on a Masters in Computer Science in Melbourne, Australia.
