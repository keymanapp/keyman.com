### Team Lead - Western Hemisphere, Developer - Android

<br />

I'm a Texan from a family of engineers, and have an MS in Software Engineering
from Southern Methodist University. Since 2000, I've been working as a software
developer, and in 2013, my family moved to southeast Asia where I joined one of
SIL's Language Technology teams. As of May 2017, I've been working remotely with
this entertaining and cross-cultural team. It's been a very encouraging
environment as we learn together how to improve Keyman for our users.

My wife and I have two children. I also enjoy playing Ultimate (frisbee), going
to the gym, and playing boardgames.
