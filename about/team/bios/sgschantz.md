### Developer - macOS, iOS

<br/>

I joined the Keyman team in 2021 in Cambodia and have focused on development for
Mac and iOS. At the start of my career I worked on Mac software for several
years, but that was long ago, when the Mac was not UNIX-based, had only
monochrome displays and used Motorola processors. Much of that ancient
experience is not so applicable now, but it has been good learning Apple's
latest technology. I spent many of the years in between working on server
software with Java for T-Mobile US.

I am fascinated by languages (even though I am only competent with one of them),
and it was eye-opening to learn the challenging Khmer script. Its complexity
helped me to better appreciate the need for Keyman.

In 2025, after over four years in Cambodia, my wife and I moved back to the US
with our triplets in time to start their junior year of high school. We now live
in Georgia which is my wife's home state. I grew up close to Seattle, and we
love taking trips as a family to Washington state to visit family and friends,
go hiking and enjoy the scenery and seafood.
