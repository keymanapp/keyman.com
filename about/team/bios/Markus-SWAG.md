### Developer - Linux

<br/>

After receiving a MSc in Computer Science from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology
(KIT), I started a more than thirty year journey from punch cards (no, you don't
need to know, what this was) to Kubernetes with some stopovers like UNIX device
drivers, high-availability systems, and database development. In between there
was an excursion as a regional secretary for the German IFES movement (SMD).

I'm married, have three adult children and live in the Frankfurt area in
Germany. After myretirement I enjoy having more time for playing saxophone
("It's not jazz, because you are just missing the tone."), having outdoor
activities andbeing a lay preacher in my local church.

I'm contributing to "Keyman for Linux".
