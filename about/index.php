<h2 class="red underline">About Keyman</h2>
<p>
  Originally created in 1993 to type Lao on Windows, Keyman is now a free and open source keyboarding platform which allows
  anyone to write a keyboard layout for their language. Keyman is available for many platforms, including Windows,
  macOS, iOS, Android, Linux and the web.
</p>
<p>
  Keyboard layouts are defined with a clear and easy to understand keyboard grammar. Keyman's contextual input model
  means keyboard layouts can be intelligent and make it simple to type even the most complex languages.
  Keyboard layouts are distributed through an open catalog to all major desktop and mobile platforms.

  I wrote the first versions of Keyman, as a teenager while living in Laos, in between home schooling and riding my
  bicycle around town fixing NGO computers. After moving to Tasmania for University, where I completed a Bachelor of
  Computing degree, I worked with my wife for a year in Papua New Guinea as a volunteer with Australian Volunteers
  International. I continued part-time development of Keyman during and after University and started working full time
  on the full suite of Keyman projects in 2005.
</p>
<p class="people-text">
  Outside work I still ride my bike. We have two daughters and one son. After living in Phnom Penh, Cambodia
  for two years, our family is back in Australia where I continue to lead the Keyman team within SIL.
  I can speak, read, and write, to varying degrees, Khmer, Lao, Thai and Tok Pisin, and used to speak French as a child.

  My name is Makara. I have just graduated with an MA in Linguistics. The topic of my thesis was about how to convert
  Khmer words into IPA. It was a really fun project to do because I got to incorporate my limited knowledge in coding
  into the making of the tool with the help of my advisor, and contribute to Khmer language research. I love to explore
  new technological things and that is why I am now here to help and learn from the Keyman team.

<p class="people-text">
  I grew up in the United States watching lots of science-fiction shows. I always loved the grand vision of the future
  those shows set out, with people of various ethnicities, races, and even species all working together in harmony...
  well, at least most of the time. This led me to a stint as a graduate student at the University of Florida, during
  which time I became interested in work in natural language processing and computational linguistics. While searching
  for data necessary for my research, I became aware of the technological issues suffered by many of the world's people
  groups - a problem that Keyman has been addressing for years. When someone lacks the ability to type effectively in
  their own language, how can we communicate or collaborate effectively with them?
</p>
<p class="people-text">
  Growing up during our new "Information Age" has given me a great appreciation for what technology can do to bring
  people together and facilitate cross-cultural relationships, but it can only do so when people can effectively use it.
  Toward this end, I completed a Doctorate of Computer Engineering there in August 2015, after which I worked for a
  year and a half as an adjunct lecturer at the University of Florida. Now, as of May 2017 I've joined the Keyman team
  as a software developer.

  I'm a Texan from a family of engineers, and have an MS in Software Engineering from Southern Methodist University.
  Since 2000, I've been working as a software developer, and in 2013, my family moved to southeast Asia where I
  joined one of SIL's Language Technology teams. As of May 2017, I've been working remotely with this entertaining and
  cross-cultural team. It's been a very encouraging environment as we learn together how to improve Keyman for
  our users.

  My wife and I have two children. I also enjoy playing Ultimate (frisbee), learning to play
  guitar, and gaming.

  I grew up in beautiful Minnesota (or Minne-SNOW-ta as some people call it). I graduated with a degree in computer
  science from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in 1991. After working as a consultant and contract programmer for
  several years in Chicago, my family and I moved to Waxhaw, NC. Since 1998, I have worked on various SIL language
  software projects to help linguists and translators do their jobs. I am fluent in Spanish, which I learned from my
  wife.

<p class="people-text">
  In addition to my software work, I also enjoy swimming and other water sports, baking and cooking, day hiking, and
  working with youth. Since 2015, my wife and I have been welcoming foster children into our home.
