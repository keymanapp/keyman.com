course completely free and open source! Go ahead and [download Keyman Developer](/developer/download)
to start creating keyboard layouts today. Once you have created a layout, you can share it online, and if you like,

## Localize Keyman for your language ## {#localize-keyman}
Many of the Keyman products have an option to change the displayed language. In Keyman for Android and
Keyman for iPhone and iPad, the Keyman UI will match your device's locale (if the translated strings are available).
If your language is not an available option, or some of the strings need to be updated, visit
[translate.keyman.com](https://translate.keyman.com/) to help translate Keyman into your language.

## Support other users ## {#support-users}
Many users come and ask questions about using Keyman in our [online community](https://community.software.sil.org/c/keyman).
Each question that you answer helps many other users who may be searching for similar answers, and allows the developers to focus
on improving Keyman! And if you have new knowledge about Keyman, you could even contribute that to the documentation &mdash; keep reading.

## Test a new version ## {#test-beta}
We frequently release updates to Keyman. Independent testing and reporting of issues is greatly appreciated. When
you test bug fixes and report issues, you help those who are depending on Keyman to work in their language, many
of whom do not have the capacity to test new versions themselves.

* [Download a pre-release version](/downloads/pre-release)
* [Report issues and feature requests](https://github.com/keymanapp/keyman/issues/new/choose)

## Write some code ## {#write-code}
Because Keyman is open source, anyone can contribute code. We love pull requests, forks and code reviews ;-). Keyman
includes C++, Java, Swift,ObjC, Delphi, Javascript and Python code, so there is something for every developer!

always room for improvement. If you spot a gap in the documentation, or a mistake, you can submit an update
through our GitHub documentation repository, by editing the source files directly online in GitHub!
