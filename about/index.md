title: About Keyman
---

Originally created in 1993 to type Lao on Windows, Keyman is now a free and open source keyboarding platform which allows
anyone to write a keyboard layout for their language. Keyman is available for many platforms, including Windows,
macOS, iOS, Android, Linux and the web.

Keyboard layouts are defined with a clear and easy to understand keyboard grammar. Keyman's contextual input model
means keyboard layouts can be intelligent and make it simple to type even the most complex languages.
Keyboard layouts are distributed through an open catalog to all major desktop and mobile platforms.
