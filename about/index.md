Keyman is a [free and open source](../free) multilingual keyboard system which
allows you to [build and share](../developer) keyboard layouts for any language.
Keyman already supports over 2,500 languages and more are contributed every
week.

Keyman was originally created in 1993 to type Lao on Windows. It  is available
for many platforms, including [Windows](../windows/), [macOS](../mac/),
[iOS](../iphone-and-ipad/), [Android](../android/), [Linux](../linux/) and the
[web](https://keymanweb.com).

Keyboard layouts are defined with a clear and easy to understand keyboard
grammar. Keyman's contextual input model means keyboard layouts can be
intelligent and make it simple to type even the most complex languages. Keyboard
layouts are distributed through an
[open catalog](https://help.keyman.com/developer/keyboards) to all major desktop and
mobile platforms.
