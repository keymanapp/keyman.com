### Marc Durdin
<br/>

I wrote the first versions of Keyman, as a teenager while living in Laos, in between home schooling and riding my
bicycle around town fixing NGO computers. After moving to Tasmania for University, where I completed a Bachelor of
Computing degree, I worked with my wife for a year in Papua New Guinea as a volunteer with Australian Volunteers
International. I continued part-time development of Keyman during and after University and started working full time
on the full suite of Keyman projects in 2005.

Outside work I still ride my bike. We have two adult daughters and one son; currently, we are living in Phnom Penh,
Cambodia where I am now the Product Owner for Keyman within SIL. I can speak, read, and write (and type!),
to varying degrees, Khmer, Lao, Thai, and Tok Pisin, and used to speak French as a child.

### Makara Sok
<br/>

My name is Makara. I have just graduated with an MA in Linguistics. The topic of my thesis was about how to convert
Khmer words into IPA. It was a really fun project to do because I got to incorporate my limited knowledge in coding
into the making of the tool with the help of my advisor, and contribute to Khmer language research. I love to explore
new technological things and that is why I am now here to help and learn from the Keyman team.

### Joshua Horton
<br/>

I grew up in the United States watching lots of science-fiction shows. I always loved the grand vision of the future
those shows set out, with people of various ethnicities, races, and even species all working together in harmony...
well, at least most of the time. This led me to a stint as a graduate student at the University of Florida, during
which time I became interested in work in natural language processing and computational linguistics. While searching
for data necessary for my research, I became aware of the technological issues suffered by many of the world's people
groups - a problem that Keyman has been addressing for years. When someone lacks the ability to type effectively in
their own language, how can we communicate or collaborate effectively with them?

Growing up during our new "Information Age" has given me a great appreciation for what technology can do to bring
people together and facilitate cross-cultural relationships, but it can only do so when people can effectively use it.
Toward this end, I completed a Doctorate of Computer Engineering there in August 2015, after which I worked for a
year and a half as an adjunct lecturer at the University of Florida. Now, as of May 2017 I've joined the Keyman team
as a software developer.

### Eberhard Beilharz
<br/>

I am one of the few non-native English speakers in the team, coming from
Germany. I have a degree in computer science from the University of Applied Sciences in
Karlsruhe. After working in a small software company for several years I joined SILâ€™s
language software development department where I worked on different projects with a focus on
maintaining cross-platform compatibility of our products. During my time with the Keyman team
I mainly worked on all aspects of Keyman for Linux.


If I happen to have some spare time I enjoy reading, bicycling and other outdoor activities.

### Darcy Wong
<br/>

I'm a Texan from a family of engineers, and have an MS in Software Engineering from Southern Methodist University.
Since 2000, I've been working as a software developer, and in 2013, my family moved to southeast Asia where I
joined one of SIL's Language Technology teams. As of May 2017, I've been working remotely with this entertaining and
cross-cultural team. It's been a very encouraging environment as we learn together how to improve Keyman for
our users.


My wife and I have two children. I also enjoy playing Ultimate (frisbee), going to the gym, and playing boardgames.

### Mark Sinclair
<br/>
I am a systems developer and experienced university teacher in computer science and telecommunications, with research interests in computational intelligence and network design. I was committed to the development of higher education in Cambodia over eighteen years, including co-founding an MSc, two university departments and a software house.  After three years at Northumbria University as Assistant Professor in Computer & Information Sciences, I moved to CAP (Christians Against Poverty) as a systems developer.  Following financial difficulties at CAP, I took voluntary redundancy, and alongside phased retirement, have subsequently had three fixed-term contracts as an MSc Project Supervisor in Computing Science at the University of Glasgow; Academic Mentor in Computer Science at NPIC (for SIL in Cambodia); and now as Senior Software Developer for SIL in Cambodia.

I have a BA and MA in Electrical Sciences from Pembroke College, University of Cambridge; an MSc in Telecommunication and Information Systems, and a PhD in Electronic Systems Engineering from the University of Essex.  I am a Chartered Engineer, a member of both the IET and IEEE, and a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy.  I am a Visiting Professor of Computer Science at NPIC in Cambodia.

I am married, with two adult children, and two cats.  I love playing computer games, reading science fiction and fantasy novels, going to the cinema and theatre, and am an active member of my local church.

### Ross Cruickshank
<br/>
With degrees in Electronics and Information Technology from QUT, I have worked across various roles in software and electronics engineering. This has given me experience in high-availability systems, microcontroller design, and software development. With Keyman, I contribute mostly to the Keyman for Windows product. I am based in Australia and outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family, mountain biking and road cycling.

### MengHeng Hav
<br/>
During my 3rd year of acquiring a computer science degree at National Polytechnic Institute of Cambodia, I got the opportunity to be involved in the Keyman's work, and until the 4th year, I got a role in Keyman as a Technical Support Engineer. If you are interested in my study, I have the source code (Laravel) of my Thesis on [GitHub](https://github.com/Meng-Heng/bus_ticketing_web).

I managed to obtain some experience through an internship in Web Development for a POS system company based in Toul Kork, Phnom Penh, Cambodia. I also worked on simplistic app and website design and development to submit the classes' deadlines and kept up with the various programming languages the school had.

After successfully defending my Thesis and graduating, I continue to have a passion for supporting Keyman's users. The responsibility of a technical support engineer is to provide and form sophisticated help instructions according to users' requirements, monitor Keyman's social platforms and blogs, write documents, report bugs to the product developers, and use programming skills to fix bugs, add features, and make updates to the Keyman websites.
