### Makara Sok
<br/>

My name is Makara. I have just graduated with an MA in Linguistics. The topic of my thesis was about how to convert
Khmer words into IPA. It was a really fun project to do because I got to incorporate my limited knowledge in coding
into the making of the tool with the help of my advisor, and contribute to Khmer language research. I love to explore
new technological things and that is why I am now here to help and learn from the Keyman team.

### Tom Bogle
<br/>

I grew up in beautiful Minnesota (or Minne-SNOW-ta as some people call it). I graduated with a degree in computer
science from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in 1991. After working as a consultant and contract programmer for
several years in Chicago, my family and I moved to Waxhaw, NC. Since 1998, I have worked on various SIL language
software projects to help linguists and translators do their jobs. I am fluent in Spanish, which I learned from my
wife.

In addition to my software work, I also enjoy swimming and other water sports, baking and cooking, day hiking, and
working with youth. Since 2015, my wife and I have been welcoming foster children into our home.

I'm from Northern Ireland and I have a Natural Sciences degree from Cambridge.
I've been working on the Linux side of Keyman since May 2018. Prior to that I've

I enjoy audax, other non-speedy cycling, and board games.
