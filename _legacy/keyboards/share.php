<h1>Sharing keyboard <?= $id ?></h1>

<p>You probably arrived here by scanning a QRCode or opening a link
to share a keyboard from the Keyman app. We are sorry, but unfortunately,
the keyboard you are interested in, called <b class='red'><?=$id?></b>, is not currently available from the
Keyman keyboards repository.</p>

<h2>How you can get this keyboard</h2>

<p>This keyboard has been distributed peer-to-peer rather than through
the Keyman keyboards repository, so the best way to access the keyboard
is to ask the person who shared this link or QRCode with you.</p>

<p>If you cannot locate the person who shared the keyboard with you,
please do feel free to ask on the <a href='https://community.software.sil.org/c/keyman'>
Keyman Community Forum</a> for assistance in locating the keyboard or
a suitable alternative.</p>
