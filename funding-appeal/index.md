title: Keep Keyman Free to All

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/cdn/dev/css/funding.css">

This year, our main partner—who has for years allowed us to offer Keyman free to
users—faced funding limitations and could not contribute. To keep this tool
available at no cost for every language community, we need your help.

# To continue, we must raise: US$280,000 by 1 March 2026

## You can help!

* GIVE what you can

* SHARE the need with your friends

We’re inviting those who care about language equity to step in and help sustain
the work. _Let’s raise US$280,000 together!_

Keyman supports thousands of Indigenous and minority languages worldwide.

Every update, security fix, new keyboard, and mobile release depends on a small
team and a global community who believe that every language deserves a place in
the digital world.

### Your support will help:

* Keep your keyboards working when phones and apps update

* Support new and improved keyboards for more languages

* Ensure Keyman stays free and open for everyone

* Create access for more language communities

# No language left offline

Our mission is to empower every language to thrive in the digital world, giving
communities the tools to read, write, and communicate in their own language—at
no cost to them.
