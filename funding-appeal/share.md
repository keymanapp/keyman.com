Please share your story of how Keyman has served you and your language
community. We would love to hear about how Keyman has impacted you!

Many people use Keyman, but the Keyman story is not about the statistics.  The
Keyman story is your story: you, the individuals, communities, and language
groups who can now type your language using Keyman.

Your stories:

* bring the Keyman project alive

* encourage the team in their continued service

* help us engage with major funders
