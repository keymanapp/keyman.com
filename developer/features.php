  <div class="section" id="keyboard">
    <h2 class="red underline">Keyboard Editor</h2>
    <p>The Keyboard Editor of Keyman Developer <?php echo $stable_version_int; ?> makes it easy to design any style of keyboard:</p>
    <br/><br/>

    <h3 class="red">Two Ways to Begin</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        1. Drag &amp; Drop Design: develop smart keyboards from the Layout page with the simplicity of drag &amp; drop.
        No technical expertise required.
      </li>
      <li>
        2. Work from the Source: use the Source page to craft enhanced keyboards, with constraints, dead keys, reordering,
        options and more.

      </li>
    </ol>
    <br/><br/>

    <h3 class="red">Touch Layouts for Mobile Devices</h3>
    <p>Create separate touch layouts for iOS and Android devices. Add longpress combinations for keys
      so users can avoid impractical shift layers.</p>
    <p><img class='borderless' src='<?= cdn('img/touch_amharic_keyboard_8.png') ?>'
      alt='Touch layout for Amharic Keyboard' /></p>
    <br/><br/>

    <h3 class="red" id="bcp47-tags">BCP 47 language tags</h3>
    <p>Give your keyboard language and script tags for automatic Office and Windows language association.</p>
    <br/><br/>

    <h3 class="red">Taskbar Icon</h3>
    <p>Devise a taskbar icon that distinguishes your keyboard <br/>at a glance.</p>
    <p><img class='borderless' src='<?= cdn('/img/developer-edit-icon.png') ?>'
      alt='Developer includes an Icon editor'/></p>
    <br/><br/>

    <hr />
    <p>Keyman Developer <?php echo $stable_version_int; ?> gives you a full set of expert features to let you build the
      most advanced possible keyboards:</p>
    <br/><br/>

    <h3 class="red">Smart Character Map</h3>
    <p>Fully Unicode <?= $unicode_version; ?>: access every character in the newest version of the Unicode Standard from the Keyman Character
      Map. </p>
    <p>Double-Click Insert: insert over 144,000 letters and symbols with a double-click. Say goodbye to multi-step
      clipboard actions.</p>
    <p>Intelligent Search: With so many Unicode characters available, there's several ways to search and filter for the
        characters in your language: partial name match, by Unicode range, block, font, or code point,
        or using standard wildcards.</p>
    <p><img src='<?= cdn('/img/devcharmap.png') ?>' alt='The Keyman Character Map '/></p>
    <br/><br/>

    <h3 class="red">Robust Programming Language</h3>
    <p>Contextual Rules: write adaptive rules that change a key's output depending on the context.</p>
    <p>Character Stores: create character stores that let rules manage multiple letters at the same time.</p>
    <p>Rule Groups: build groups of rules to handle the same input differently in different situations.</p>
    <p>Options: construct temporary or saveable options that activate different rules and groups based on end-user
      selections.</p>
    <p><img class='borderless' src='<?= cdn('/img/code.png') ?>' alt="Keyman Developer Programming Examples "/></p>
    <p>Keys in Any Shift-State: remap almost any key in any combination of shift-states - Ctrl, Alt, Shift, Caps and
      AltGr.</p>
    <p>Multi-Character Output: set any key to output over 1,000 characters at once from anywhere in Unicode.</p>
    <p>Deadkeys &amp; Statements: define deadkeys that impact output without leaving a trace. Use over 20 other
      statements to shape precision rules.</p>
    <p>Two Layout Types: develop keyboards with fixed layouts or ones that shift to match a users' hardware.</p>
    <p><img class='borderless' src='<?= cdn('/img/code2.png') ?>' alt='Keyman Developer Programming Examples '/></p>
    <br/><br/>

    <h3 class="red">Complete Debugging Tools</h3>
    <p>In-Application Testing: test your keyboards in Keyman Developer without opening another program.</p>
    <p>Single-Step Mode: debug your keyboard rules line by line to find the exact cause of your keyboard problem.</p>
    <p>Regression Testing: write and save tests to run again on different systems or with future updates.</p>
    <p>With Windows Layouts: check how your keyboard behaves on the complete range of Windows layouts.</p>
