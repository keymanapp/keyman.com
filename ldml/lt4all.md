## Introducing Unicode CLDR Keyboards

### An open keyboard specification and repository designed for Indigenous languages

## **CLDR Keyboards** are software keyboard layouts

* Desktop and laptop computers
* Touchscreen devices – phones and tablets
* IoT devices that support text input

## Benefits for your language community

* CLDR Keyboard WG is creating a clear process for authors to submit keyboard
  layouts to CLDR
* Engage with the CLDR team – no need to build multiple relationships with
  industry vendors
* Submission process is open and transparent
* New and updated keyboards will be distributed on a regular schedule to vendors
* Copyright remains with the creator of the keyboard (usage rights are provided
  to vendors via CLDR contributors agreement)

## Who is involved?

* [Unicode Consortium][1] – CLDR Keyboard Working Group
* Major industry vendors are implementing the specification in operating systems
  and devices
* [SIL Global][2] develops Keyman – an open source and free implementation for
  CLDR keyboards
* [Translation Commons][3] creates keyboards for Indigenous communities

## Designed for Indigenous and low-resource language needs

* Simple, concise high-level keyboard design language
* Cross-platform by design
* Minimal reference to hardware
* Transforms provide complex script support
  * reordering, recombining, normalization
  * user-friendly typing experience
  * produce consistent output

## About CLDR – the Common Locale Data Repository

* A home for all industry vendors to intake locale and cultural data – and now also keyboard layouts
* Already in use by all major software companies (including Amazon, Apple,
  Google, Meta, Microsoft etc.) for calendar, language, and regional metadata

## About Keyman

* Free, open source software keyboard – MIT licensed
* Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and web
